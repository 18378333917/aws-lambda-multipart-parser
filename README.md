# aws-lambda-multipart-parser
## Introduction
Support of multipart/form-data requests is a relatively new feature for AWS Lambdas. 
Although, there is such feature, majority of libraries for parsing multipart/form-data requests is based on server technology, which can't be used in case of AWS Lambdas. That's why, AWS Lambda specific multipart/form-data parser was created.
